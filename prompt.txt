I want you to build me a **Laravel application** for managing company accounting and finance.  
Use **Blade templates with Tailwind CSS** for styling.  
Use **jQuery only if JavaScript is absolutely necessary**.  
Keep the code clean, modular, and optimized for **low server cost**.  

### Features:
1. **Authentication & User Management**
   - Simple login/register with Laravel Breeze (Blade version).
   - Users can have roles: Admin, Accountant, Viewer.

2. **Dashboard**
   - Show total income, total expenses, and current balance.
   - Show recent transactions.
   - Show charts (use Chart.js or ApexCharts) for monthly income vs expenses.

3. **Expense Management**
   - CRUD for daily expenses (date, category, amount, description).
   - Categories: Office, Salary, Rent, Utility, Others.
   - Blade form with validation & error messages.
   - Paginated & searchable expense list.

4. **Income Management**
   - CRUD for daily income (date, source, amount, description).
   - Income sources: Sales, Investments, Services, Others.
   - Paginated & searchable income list.

5. **Reporting**
   - Income report by date range.
   - Expense report by date range.
   - Profit & loss statement.
   - Export reports to **PDF & Excel**.

6. **Settings**
   - Manage categories (for both income & expenses).
   - Company profile (name, address, logo).

### Technical Requirements:
- Use **Laravel** with **Blade templates**.
- Styling with **Tailwind CSS** (clean, simple, responsive).
- Use **Eloquent ORM** for database operations.
- Use **Migrations & Seeders** to create tables.
- Use **Laravel Excel** for exporting reports.
- Use **laravel-dompdf** for PDF export.
- Use **Chart.js** for charts in dashboard & reports.
- Optimize queries with eager loading where needed.
- Use **resource controllers** and **form requests** for validation.
- Keep code structured: Models, Controllers, Views (Blade), Routes.
- No heavy frontend frameworks (no React/Vue).

### Database Schema (suggested):
- users (id, name, email, password, role)
- incomes (id, date, source, amount, description, user_id)
- expenses (id, date, category, amount, description, user_id)
- categories (id, name, type [income/expense])
- company_profile (id, name, address, logo)

### Goal:
A **lightweight but functional accounting and finance system** that runs smoothly on a **low-cost VPS (1GB RAM)**.  
Make the UI clean and professional with **Tailwind CSS**.
